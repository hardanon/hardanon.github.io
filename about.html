        <h1>What is Hardpad?</h1>
        <span>Hardpad laptops are hardened ThinkPads configured and optimized to protect your privacy. They use Libreboot, an open-source and free BIOS that disables Intel ME and makes boot time faster. They also come with Qubes OS by default on models after the T420. We can adapt the laptop to your needs; for instance, if you need to remove the microphone, camera, and Wi-Fi, we can do that. We personalize your laptop for YOU! Moreover, because we want to ensure secure transactions, all payments are made with Monero, and shipping is discreet and neutral. This way, nobody knows you have a Hardpad. The Hardpad also maintains the default appearance of a ThinkPad because the more basic it looks, the better.</span>

        <h1>How can I know if the payment is secure?</h1>
        <span>Our goal is primarily to help non-technical individuals obtain secure laptops. Consequently, we want to ensure that all communications, payments, and shipping are as anonymous as possible. You can send us an email with PGP (if you don't know how to use PGP, check: <a class="a-about" href="how-to-use-pgp.html">How to use PGP</a>). We also ensure that transactions are secured by using Monero.</span>
        <h1>Who needs a Hardpad laptop?</h1>
        <span>Again, our goal is to make Hardpad the new standard for individuals who need good privacy. This can include activists, anarchists, journalists, hacktivists, youâ€”EVERYONE! We believe privacy is a right, a right that should be available to everyone.</span>
        <h1>How are Hardpad laptops shipped?</h1>
        <span>The shipping cost is your responsibility; you will pay for it. We proceed this way because shipping costs really depend on where you live, and the price can vary significantly. We strongly recommend that you check the best delivery service in your country and discuss it with us so we can find the best and most convenient option for you.</span>
